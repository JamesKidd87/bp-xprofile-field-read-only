Make BuddyPress XProfile fields readonly for non-admins

== Description ==

Looking for admin-only editable fields? Now you can make BuddyPress XProfile field inputs* readonly (text/number/url) or disabled (date/multi/select/radio/checkbox) for all non-admins. This plugin comes with filters to support custom field types.

*) As BuddyPress does not provide any hooks to completely replace field inputs for plain field values, we'll have to do it this way :(

== Installation ==

If you download BP XProfile Field Read Only manually, make sure it is uploaded to "/wp-content/plugins/bp-xprofile-field-read-only/".

Activate BP XProfile Field Read Only in the "Plugins" admin panel using the "Activate" link. If you're using WordPress Multisite, you can choose to activate BP XProfile Field Read Only network wide for full integration with all of your sites.
